## Angular Forms



## Objectives

* Learn how to use the Angular directives for creating forms.
* Know how Angular forms can be validated, client-side validation.


## Demo

##### All code will be included in the index.html.
_(Not great, but will get us through these simple demo files.)_

The below is a recap of this article, [Angular JS Forms](http://tutorials.jenkov.com/angularjs/forms.html).

Work thru these files in order. (See the *_done.html for finished versions)

* simple_input_form.html  
* simple_checkbox_form.html  
* simple_radio_form.html
* simple_select_form.html
* complex_select_form.html  
* complex_select2_form.html
* length_valid_form.html
* regexp_valid_form.html
* required_valid_form.html
* field_state_form.html

## Lab 
Refactor the field_state_form to seperate the controller, view and css.

## Lab
#### Back End
Create a backend Rails API using the rails-api gem. It should return a set of people where each person has a first/last name, age, agreement status, newletter subscription status and car make the person is interested in. 

#### Front End
Show a list or table of all these people in the angular client side code.

Create new people using the form we worked on above. _(Add client and server side validations)_
